Process: this is an instance of a program (e.g a python interpreter)

+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Seperate memory space -> Memory is not shared between processes
+ Greate for CPU-bound processing
+ New process is stated independently from other processes
+ Processes are interuptable/killable
+ One GIL for each process -> avoids GIL limitation

- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread.
- More memory
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complecated
