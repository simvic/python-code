Threads: this is an entity within a process that can be scheduled (also known as lightweight process)

+ All threads within a process share the same memory
+ lightweight
+ starting a thread is faster than starting a process
+ Great for I/O-bound tasks

- Threading is limited by GIL: Only one thread at a time
- No effect for CPU-bound tasks
- Not interuptable/killable
- Careful with race conditions
